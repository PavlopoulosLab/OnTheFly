Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p110 subunit plays a key role in the humoral immune response (PubMed:8816802, PubMed:10619029, PubMed:11269501, PubMed:11872802, PubMed:22022271). Rel-p68 subunit translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the promoter of the Cecropin A1 gene and probably other antimicrobial peptide genes (PubMed:11269501). I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKKbeta and key) and PGRP-LC are essential signaling components in transmitting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal leading to cact degradation for NF-kappa-B (rel) activation (PubMed:11872802, PubMed:11018014). Part of a Toll-related receptor pathway that functions in the apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition (PubMed:25477468). May be part of a NF-kappa-B and Tollo signaling cascade that regulates development of the peripheral nervous system (PubMed:18000549). Possibly post-transcriptionally regulates the neuron-specific genes sc and ase, by promoting the rapid turnover of their transcripts in the wing imaginal disk (PubMed:18000549).
